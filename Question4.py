# Question 4 : Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. You can
# expect the string length is less than 100, and only contains English letters.
# Modify the “solution” class in question4.py, you may design your input to test it.

class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        CurrChar_set = set()
        MaxLeng = 0
        left_pointer = 0

# Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
s = "abcabcbb"
