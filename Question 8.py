# Question 8 : Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.
# An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase,
# typically using all the original letters exactly once.
# Modify the “solution” function in the question8.py. (Analyze your time complexity)

# Ex Case 2
